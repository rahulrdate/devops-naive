## Introduction
Version Control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.

Few widely used version control tools are:
- Git
- Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
- Apache Subversion (SVN)
- Mercurial

Git is a free, widely used and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### Advantages of Version Control
- A complete long-term change history of every file. This means every change made by many individuals over the years. Changes include the creation and deletion of files as well as edits to their contents.
- Branching and merging. Having team members work concurrently is a no-brainer, but even individuals working on their own can benefit from the ability to work on independent streams of changes.
- Traceability. Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bug tracking software such as Jira.

Apart from above benefit, version control plays an important role in designing CI/CD pipelines.
